Anagramarama
============

Updated 2020 by hackerb9.

* Added default Makefile for UNIX systems with the ability to 'make
install'. Note that this uses a simple wrapper script as the
anagramarama source still is hardcoded to look in the current working
directory for resource files. (Didn't Debian fix that over a decade
ago? Oh, well. This kludge will do for now.)

Outstanding Bugs
================

* Should search paths for data directory instead of presuming
  everything is in the current working directory.

* No full screen

* Prints warnings on stderr that it can't find i18n dictionaries.
  Should only be garrulous if something goes wrong.
